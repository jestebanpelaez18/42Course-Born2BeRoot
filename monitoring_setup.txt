**Install crontab**

The script will display some information (listed below) on all terminals every 10 minutes.
For that we have to install crontab.

- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install cron

**Create the script**

Then we type:

- cd /usr/local/bin/

Then we write the script:

- emacs monitoring.sh

Finally we give all the permissions:

- chmod 777 monitoring.sh

**Enter to cronjob**

The we run the next command to enter cronjob:

- sudo crontab -e

Now we have to type the next message at the end of the file, if we wan to run the program every 10 minutes:

-*/10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh

If we want to run the script, we type the next command:

- sudo /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh
