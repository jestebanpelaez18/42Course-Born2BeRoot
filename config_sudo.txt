**Install Sudo**

Firts of all we swicht to root using su command.

- su -

It will ask for the password of the root user that you specified during the installation of Debian.

Then we use the next command to install sudo package.

- apt-get install sudo

**Config sudo**

We have to add the user in the sudo group, in my case, my user is jpelaez-. Run this command.

- sudo usermod -aG groupname username

In my case is:

- sudo usermod -aG sudo jpelaez-

If we want to check if our user name is in the group, we use the next command:

- sudo getent group sudo

*Create a group*

We have to create a new group with the name of user42, if we want to create a new group we use the next command.

- sudo groupadd groupname

In my case:

- sudo groupadd user42

Finally we add our username to that group.

- sudo usermod -aG user42 jpelaez-

**Set up a strong configuration for sudo group**

We need to set up a strong configuration for our sudo group. We have to check the file configuration to modify the behavior of sudo command, this file we can find in /etc/sudoers/. Firts we can check the file, with the next command.

- sudo cat /etc/sudoers

If we want to modify the file we must to edited with "visudo".

- sudo visudo /etc/sudoers

If we want to modify the behavior of sudo command we have to use **Defaults** entries. We have to add the next rules.

*Defaults   secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
Defaults    requiretty
Defaults    logfile="/var/log/sudo/"
Defaults    badpass_message="Clave Incorrecta"
Defaults    passwd_tries=3
Defaults    log_input,log_output
*
