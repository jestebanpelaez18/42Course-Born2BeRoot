**What is UFW?**

it means "Uncomplicated Firewall" and refers to an application that aims to set rules in the native firrewall tables in Linux, which is call "iptables". Due iptables has a complex syntax, using UFW to configure it is really helpfull.

**Install and config UFW**

Firts refresh the APT cache, with that we are gonna check for recent updates. We use the next command.

-sudo apt update

Then we install the UFW on Debian, we use the next command.

-sudo apt install ufw

By default ufw is not actived, then we have to active. We use the next command.

-sudo ufw enable

Check if it is active:

- sudo systemctl status ufw

Then we have to define the rules. In this case we have to allow port number 4242 in UFW. We run the next command.

-sudo ufw allow 4242

Finally we check the status with the next command:

-sudo ufw status numbered
